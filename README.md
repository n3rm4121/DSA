- Algorithms and data
structures are two main components of a problem solution.

- An algorithm is a step by step
procedure for performing a task within the specified time.

- A data structure
is a way of storing and organizing our data.

- A data structure's
major operations include insertion, modification, deletion,
searching, sorting, merging
and traversals. 

- Abstract data types,
ADT represents the type of the data and the operations
without revealing the way of the implementation.

- Data structures are of linear types and nonlinear types.

- In a linear data structure,
data is arranged in a linear or sequential order
whereas in a non-linear data structure, data is stored
in a non sequential order.
